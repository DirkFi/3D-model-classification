## 3D model classification based on unsupervised domain adaptation

This method focuses on resolving the domain shifts between the source domain (ImageNet) and the target domain (3D model rendering) to give a correct classification of the 3D model itself.

When it comes to 3D models, there are many ways to represent them, like point clouds, model embedding, etc. Or, we can use 3D version of CNN in 3D models. However, these methods can only be applied to small dataset or dataset whose resolution is pretty low. Also, most state-of-art methods are based on supervised learning.

So, in this case, we consider using unsupervised domain adaptation to accomplish the task of classification.

- We render the 3D models to 12 images containing different information.
- Mark rendered images as target domain and ImageNet as source domain.
- Leverage Maximum Classifier Discrepancy method to solve the domain shifts.

## To run the code
### Packages Install
Use
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install neede packages. About the torch version, it's better to use the GPU version. See https://pytorch.org/.

### Way to change dataset link
In the ***args*** parameter, change test_path, train_path, val_path to your own path. Remember the format is ImageNet.

### Run the code
Next, you can run the code, but it should be noted that the final accuracy rate is the accuracy rate of the model classification generated by the fusion of 12 multi-view images, not the accuracy rate obtained by detecting each image one by one.

Run
```
python res_train_main_D.py
```


## 基于无监督域适应的三维模型分类研究

本方法集中于把源域（ImageNet）和目标域（3D模型渲染图）的域差异解决，从而给出对3D模型本身的正确分类。


## 跑通代码的步骤

### 环境安装
具体的环境安装放在同文件夹下的requirements.txt里；关于torch的安装，最好使用GPU版本，查看官网的安装方式：https://pytorch.org/.

### 修改数据集链接
具体的修改位置，在代码args里的test_path, train_path, val_path里，将内容改为自己的数据集即可。注意数据集格式为ImageNet类型。即

------------>文件夹

-------->类名1

-->图片1

...

-->图片n


------->类名m

-->图片...

### 运行代码
接下来就可以跑代码了，但要注意最后生成的准确率是按照多视图12张融合生成的模型准确率，并不是每一张图片一
一检测得到的准确率。 

运行的文件是res_train_main_D.py
命令行运行：
```
python res_train_main_D.py
```

## Done.
